# SomeContract - Comprehensive Overview

Welcome to the detailed documentation for the "SomeContract" smart contract, implemented in the Move programming language. This document aims to provide a thorough understanding of the contract's structure, encompassing a struct, a resource, and various functions. The utilization of distinct access modifiers ensures controlled visibility and accessibility throughout the contract.

# Contract Overview

## SomeStruct

### Definition:

"SomeStruct" is a fundamental component of the contract, serving as a struct that encapsulates four variables and three functions.

### Variables:

a, b, c, and d:
These variables are defined within SomeStruct, each with unique access modifiers and scopes.

### Functions

publicFunc, contractFunc, and privateFunc:
SomeStruct features publicFunc, contractFunc, and privateFunc, each designed for different purposes and accessible from specific areas. This highlights the contract's flexibility and modularity.

# SomeResource
## Definition:
"SomeResource" is a resource type within the contract, comprising a variable (e) and a function (resourceFunc).

# Variable:
e:
This variable has a specific access scope within the contract, demonstrating controlled visibility.
Function:
resourceFunc:
This function can be invoked from a specific area, showcasing the contract's ability to control accessibility to resources.
Functions
The contract defines three top-level functions:

#  createSomeResource:
## Description:
Creates a new instance of SomeResource and returns it.
# questsAreFun:
## Description:
A straightforward function with a designated area for execution, contributing to the contract's modular design.
init:
Description:
The constructor function initializes the contract and creates an instance of SomeStruct, named testStruct.
Variable and Function Scopes
Comments at the end of the contract offer a detailed breakdown of variable and function scopes:

# Variables
a:
Read and written from areas 1, 2, 3, and 4.

b:
Read from areas 1, 2, 3, and 4; written only from area 1.

c:
Read from areas 1, 2, and 3; written from area 1.

d:
Read and written from area 1.

e:
Read from areas 1, 2, 3, and 4; written only from area 2.

# Functions
publicFunc:
Callable from areas 1, 2, 3, and 4.

# contractFunc:
Callable from areas 1, 2, and 3.

# privateFunc:
Callable from area 1.

# Areas
Different areas within the contract:

## Area 1:
Main contract scope.

## Area 2:
Scope of SomeResource functions and variables.

## Area 3:
Specific section or scope within functions.

## Area 4:
Main contract scope (same as Area 1).

Understanding these areas is crucial for determining where variables and functions can be accessed and utilized within the contract, ensuring controlled and secure interactions. Feel free to explore and modify the "SomeContract" smart contract based on this comprehensive guide.
